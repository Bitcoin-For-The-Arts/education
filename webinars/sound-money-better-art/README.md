# Sound Money, Better Art

**Date:** 2026-02-12

## Overview

A philosophical deep dive into the relationship between money, time, and art.
From ancient civilizations to the modern fiat experiment, economic systems have
shaped what artists create, how long they spend creating it, and whether their
work endures. This session explores how inflation drives high time preference
and cultural decay, how sound money enabled the greatest artistic achievements
in human history, and why Bitcoin represents a return to the economic foundation
that great art has always required.
