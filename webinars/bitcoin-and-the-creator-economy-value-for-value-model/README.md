# Bitcoin & the Creator Economy: The Value-for-Value Model

**Date:** 2026-02-12

**Series:** Bitcoin & the Creator Economy (Part 1 of 3)

## Overview

The first installment of the Bitcoin & the Creator Economy series. Before the
tools and tactics, you need to understand the idea. Value for Value is an
economic model where creators provide their work freely and audiences pay what
they believe it's worth — directly, instantly, with no middlemen. This session
traces V4V from its historical roots through its modern Bitcoin-powered revival,
and explains why it is the most honest and sustainable model for creative work
ever conceived.
